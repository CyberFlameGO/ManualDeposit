# Properties file to define meta data for an entity
#
# Structure of an entry is:
# FieldName=comma separated list describing the field thus:
# FieldName=SortOrder,DataFieldDescription,DataType,IsCompulsory,SavedWithTemplate,AllowsMultipleRows,IsSetBySystem(read only),WillBeUploaded,ListItems
# Where:
#	FieldName is the name of the field.  Text/numbers only, no blanks allowed.
#	SortOrder is needed because the standard Java property loading facility
#		jumbles up the order.
#	DataFieldDescription is what gets displayed to the user as the field name
#		This is generally a more descriptive version of the field name.
#		Any characters are allowed except a comma
#	DataType is one of:
#		Date		Date value
#		MultiSelect	Constrained list of values - user will select from a 
#						drop-down list of values.  These values are defined
#						in the last field on the line (ListItems).
#		Integer		Whole number only - no decimal point
#		RealNumber	Any number including decimal points
#		Text		General purpose anything goes
#		Boolean		Yes/No (true/false)
#   IsCompulsory. Yes/No. If Yes, the user cannot submit the item until this meta
#		data item is completed.
#   SavedWithTemplate. Yes/No. If Yes, this meta data item will be saved when
#		a template is saved & loaded again when the template is loaded.
#   AllowsMultipleRows. Yes/No.  If Yes, the system will automatically add
#		a blank version of this attribute when an existing blank attribute
#		is modified.
#   IsSetBySystem. Yes/No.  If Yes, this makes it read-only for the user.
#		It also overrides the SavedWithTemplate flag as it will not be saved
#		or loaded with the templates.
#   WillBeUploaded. Yes/No.  If no, this is a display-only field that will NOT be
#       stored in the METS file.
#       Intended for use to display extra identifying information from the CMS System
#   ListItems. The list of items that will populate the drop-down for a 
#		multi-select data type.
#		The list should be delimited by a |
#		
# Examples:
#	Note the multi-select items at the end
#	Source=6,Capture System,MultiSelect,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Quadrega|Trirega|Quintrega
#
#	Note that there is no data after the IsSetBySystem flag - this is because
#		it is not a multi-select field
#	CMSIdentifier=1,CMS Identifier,Text,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,
FileFixity=12,File Fixity,Text,No,Yes,No,No,No,
ProvenanceEvent=14,Provenance Event,Text,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,
