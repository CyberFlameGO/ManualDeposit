This directory contains the scripts & profiles that may be used to run the server-side (Unix-side) version of Indigo.

Unix-side version of Indigo is nothing but the Indigo application running in a Unix environment with the GUI transported back to the user's PC using X-Windows emulators such as X-Ming.
