#74 	Issue with restarting running jobs when closed and reopen Indigo

#427 	IEs from Indigo submitted to Rosetta without the files

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INDIGO Release 2.3 has the following changes.

New attributes eventDescription and eventDateTime in the Provenance Note DNX element.
Fix for 
Ticket #250:	When a job is being loaded, it takes a state 'Batching'. If Indigo is closed in this stage and opened later, the job queue is completely wiped off.
		At the moment the fix provides a way to take the jobs that were stopped abruptly which has 'Batching' to be re-processed from the beginning.
		
		The provenance event outcome detail field changed to be text area instead of a text field and be able to take more characters.
		The provenance event outcome detail field is limited to the max. length of characters at the Indigo config. level. When this limit is exceeded 
		it should show a message to the user.
